This directory contains example CodeAxe command sequences to analyze
real and simulated data. Each command sequence is formated so that
it can either be copied and pasted individually onto the command 
line, or the entire file can be run as a shell script.

Examples 2 and 3 use mammalian beta-globin tree topologies and
alignments derived from Ziheng Yang's supporting data for:

Yang, Nielsen, Goldman, and Pedersen. 2000. Codon-substitution models
for heterogeneous selection pressure at amino acid sites. Genetics
155:431-449

The file 'bglobinMam.tree' has been slightly modified from the
original to be rooted between marsupial and the other mammals.
