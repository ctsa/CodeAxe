mcmc presteps:

need continuous simulation sequence output for mcmc and other uses.

issues -> 
"sim-size" needs to be size in nucs or codons, explicitely -- "state-size" is going away.
  keep it implicitely switching between either nucs or codons depending on context
sequence pad size needs to be handled differently, but how exactly? 
  does it really matter that much? maybe this should be left be.
eliminate context-free
simulator can only represent
change simulator to internal represent nucs instead of codons? is this necassary? NO... it's 
already debuged and tested... live with it.


is mcmc model file going to change? -- well certainly, the model file only
represents a single state, and it would do a better job of that if edge-strength
was removed...


most gtor objects are going to have to be elaborated with more direct and meaningful
paramater access, for the mcmc model, they're "generating" different values -- things that
appear to be much closer to individual parameters (even if they are leaner under the hood) than what the ML model wants.

limitations
 -all version inherit limits: gaps treated as 'N's
 -initial version is nuc only

issues:
  "state-size" no longer means anything, but there will be a "nuc" and "codon" version of mcmc models
 maybe we should produce a base class for most objects and subclass
an mcmc and ml version from there? So many issues I think we just need to start doing it.
