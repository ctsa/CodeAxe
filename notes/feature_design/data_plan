formats:
1)site
2)pair
3)raw - continuous, no state assignments, assumed filtered -- "ready to be converted into any model operation
4)cont site - might not every actually need such format, or at least no need to write to disk, but something
  has to go into the HMM's
workflow:
) process-seq
  seq-files->raw w/ quality filtration

) convert-data
  raw->other

) sim
  write to raw only -- can be piped staight to convert-data mode if necessary 


todo:
  tighten up raw seq format -- use NUC::index_t, maybe make new struct just to ease the transition
  rsd io


secondary:
  separate fsa read and filtration, so as to allow filtration to be applied to other file formats


just go with totally new format
n_seqs fixed
pickup after cat sync issues are worked out -- eventually need tmp info tacked on 
for the transition -or- move filtration to after the cat read
structure:
  monolithic seq*base precludes filtration
  cat
  codon_p
  contuitoy
  align_no
