lock policy:
0) lock is (obviously) absolute for independent params
1) lock is absolute for non-independent params during minimization update
2) if all params in a non-independent set are locked, they may be adjusted to 
normalization conditions. if one param is free, then this param must be used
to meet norm requirements
