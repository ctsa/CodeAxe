allow an option for the bg distro used by rate_gtor to be trained from parameters

-- this has to change the model file 

introduce this initially as a sequential only caetegory -- so that it works something like obs

how would this look to the user?
-bg-model full -cat-model 0{gmm{0}gbg{0}}

where the default was:
-bg-model obs-avg


- make plans to expand this to a full branch category later -- see if you can't get rid of non-cat
bg distribution altogether


-- for now: 
- get rid of bg_pdistro_nscodon/bg_pdistro_nuc_pos ***done
- get rid of bg_pdistro_nuc ***done

- make prob_gtor_param load_state() (you'll be using this for the bg param distro)
- make a CAT_PARAM_TYPE:: for BG (or come up with a better name) -- we'll call these PARAM_BG
- make an abstract category type for number of bg-distro's (based on obs or based on bg_cats) like the type in root-gtor
- rate gtor has to become a param_composite!! ouch!
