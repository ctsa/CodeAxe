Requirements:

) support all current capabilities independent combinations of
  unassigned categoires. assigned site categories combined with
  unassigned group categories.


Think About:

) support for continuous cats: param = x * (cat_val)*y
  applicable to burial and GC%, etc: CAN'T BE DONE (efficiently)

) multiplicative combination of mutation matrices, that is
  can aa burial helical region be represented by the 
  marginal matrix of each type?

) assigned cats are not site or group cats, site-ness and group-ness
  refer to strategies to recover unassigned cats, so each assigned cat
  set could have it's unassigned members linked to the corresponding
  site or group cat

) cats on branch subsets



arbitrary cat layout --
simple stuff might look like:

"""
set1=(S1,S2,S3)
set2=(R1,R2)

cat1=S1,R1
cat2=S1,R2
cat3=S2,R1
cat4=S2,R2
cat5=S3,R1
cat6=S3,R2
"""


simple data cat:
"""
set:
S site selection 2 unassigned:inter,buried:buried,exposed:exposed
R site rate 2

cats:
S1 R1
S1 R2
S2 R1
S2 R2
"""


or something more structured:

"""
start set 
label="S"
number=3
type=selection_strength
end set

start set
label="R"
number=2
type=mutation_rate
end set


start cats
S1,R1
S1,R2
S2,R1
end cats
"""

other -- think about training a non-independence parameter, for instance to show that
mutation rate and selection strength were correlated


"""
tracks: rate ratem ss sm root prob
cat1     R1    x   S1  x   x   0.1
"""

new way with three alternate data-freecat combo's

#1 one cat locks to another:
"""
<SET r1>
type=site_mut_rate
number=1

<SET r2>
type=site_mut_rate
number=1

<SET sm>

<CATS>
sm[1]*r1
sm[2]*r2
"""


#2 one cat crosses with another:
"""
<SET r>
type=site_mut_rate
number=2

<SET sm>
type=site_sel_matrix
datacatmap=buried:buried,exposed:exposed

<CATS>
sm*r
"""


#3 one cat crosses each data cat:
"""
<SET r1>
type=site_mut_rate
