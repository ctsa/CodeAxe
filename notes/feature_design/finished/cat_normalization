problem: multiple model cats and multiple tree cats together, how to normalize the dependent paramater?

think of these situations:

0) tr1+mm1

1) tr1+mm1,tr2+mm1

2) tr1+mm1,tr1+mm2

3) tr1+mm1,tr2+mm2

4) tr1+mm1,tr2+mm1,tr1+mm2,tr2+mm2


distinguishing 3+4 is the hard part.

so, if we think of normalizing each mm separately:
  1) each mm must scale all tr's it touches

there's still only one dependent parameter in the general situation,
however each separate tree/model group introduces a new dependent parameter

test:
given the mm-ti graph, find the number of subgraphs
or
for each mm:
  check if trs have a set label:
    if yes, label mm as belonging to the set of its tr's
    if no, tr's are not label, add a new set, and label all tr's with set no matter what.
