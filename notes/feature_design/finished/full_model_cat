getting to full model group categories

what's needed --

0. move group cats into the cat-manager (started -- getting into issues:)

  0a. move group cat control into cat-manager w/o changing any other flow (done)

  0b. generalize sel matrix,root, and mut model to work on the group level (done)
    - start with sel matrix : issues -- 
      specifying which mix type is connected
      getting the probabilities right

  0c. make generalized param_object that allows handling of locked parameter lists (done)
    put this above rate_gtor/prob_gtor and now cat_manger & time_gtor

issue 1 -- need to put cat probs into cat_manager

  0a. generalize param-object functions over prob-gtor...  (done)

  0a2. fix any non-general prob-gtor elements. (easy)

  0b. move cat probs into cat-manager using a prob-generator which will eventaully
     allow the replication of the more resricted (old) parameterization. for more
     general parameterizations, it should always take the marginal for individual
     typed parameter probs and this will be the stopgap solution for this phase (done)

  0c. allow recreation of old parameterization (---pass--)
  

1. we need any type of branch time category, this doesn't exist yet at all (done)
   and group branch time category

3. new cl inteface for generalized cats
