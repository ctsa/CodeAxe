eventually, we need general dependencies between sub-objects,
ie, I have two asymmetric selection strength matrix categories, and I
want all degrees of freedom in matrix #1 and matrix #2 to use matrix #1 values with 
selection strength modifiers for hydrophobic and polar values.

first application can be written in a fairly non-general way (whatever gets it done),
it will be to get a GC content paramater to scale a root distribution
